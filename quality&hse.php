                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.4s" data-wow-delay=".3s">Since its inception in 2011, Probus has kept track of health, safety, security, and environmental (HSSE) statistics in order to monitor and improve on standards. Since then, there have been no fatalities. Furthermore, Probus sits below the industry standard for any type of accident, with the highest incidence still less than 5 times lower than the norm. This is a clear testament to Probus’s dedication to the safety and well-being of every single employee, and to the exceptionally thorough and rigorous testing and implementation of our safety measures when we operate.</p>

                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.4s" data-wow-delay=".3s">Probus gets involved with HSSE through several channels, first and foremost, by designing and clearly communicating robust policies and safety procedures which are followed by all labourers in order to ensure safe practices in the workplace. We also have periodic safety performance reviews where we observe our key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmark them against the industry tandards as well as our past performances. With regular audits and steering committee meetings, paired with management walkthroughs, we ensure that everyone is updated and aware of the HSSE initiatives and procedures. Finally, a HSSEQ incentive program that rewards good performance, as well as rotating monthly campaigns that go more in depth and explain different safety hazards as well as how to address them, ensure that Probus employees stay at the top of their game year- round, and the numbers reflect this.</p>

                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration="0.4s" data-wow-delay=".3s">Managing the numerous hazards in the construction industry is absolutely essential to maintaining a safe workplace. We begin by conducting risk assessments and HAZID/HAZOP reviews which allow us to find areas or situations that might be unsafe. Then, it’s on to training and development, giving our workers the necessary tools to keep safe on the job. We have a safety observation card system that allows for easy and efficient reporting of any safety issues. This also lets us investigate incidents and near misses and to respond rapidly and effectively to any safety hazards. Finally, we are prepared to deal with incidents through our emergency response plans, ensuring that any damage is minimized.</p>

This is a continuous and iterative process that starts with safety reviews and KPI analysis. From there, we run both internal and external audits to not only make sure that we are in compliance with laws and regulations but also to identify any areas that can be improved upon. We also use all empirical data that we collect through our safety alerts, lessons learnt, and observation cards in order to have a feedback mechanism that works to continuously improve our safety measures.</p>
